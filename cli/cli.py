## What was I supposed to do here? Wrap the entire client? Should that not be done in __init__.py of this folder? Or is __init__.py just an import wrapper?
## Here are the functions, which all stem from a run_client() function here, called in the paren __init__.py. This __init.py__ is just for imports.

## THIS FILE SHOULD  BE OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER AND IMPORT THE CLIENT FOLDER? OR VICEVERSA

## FLOW: Here we have the cli function that is called by parent __init__.py

## TO EXIT PROGRAM
