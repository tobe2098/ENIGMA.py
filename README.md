# ENIGMA_py.py
Personal adaptation of the classic ENIGMA machine to a python environment, with random seed setups and setup storage.

## Stage:
Still in development

## Instructions for use:
-Use blah blah blah

## Recommendations:
-For easy use and fun, randomly generated setups are the best.
-For airtight security, setup your ENIGMA machine manually and keep the machine saved. Communicating the setup to another party is considerably harder, but if done appropiately should be as secure as encryption is able to be.
