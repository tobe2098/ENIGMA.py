# Physical reproduction
One could wonder if reproducing the odd number of characters would be possible...

Just make a dual circuit for every letter. Basically every contact pin in the rotors, reflector and plugboard has two cables, one for "incoming" and the other for "outcoming" current. By doing this duplication the circuit can be closed in a manner that allows a letter on the reflector to be wired to itself.
