# The 27th character 
IMPORTANT POSSIBILITY IS TO MAKE THE REFLECTOR HAVE TWO LETTERS (OR ONE, SEE BELOW) THAT CONNECT TO THEMSELVES TO ALLOW FOR 
A SELF-LETTER ENCRYPTION, BYPASSING ENIGMA'S FIRST FLAW.' ALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN ADD A SINGLE LETTER 'VOID' THAT BYPASSES THAT ROTOR OR REFLECTOR, 
HAVING THE SAME EFFECT WITHOUT BREAKING THE MACHINE. THIS LAST OPTION DOES NOT WORK IN ELECTROMECHANICAL VERSION UNLESS EVERY ELECTRODE HAS TWO PATHWAYS, ONE FW ONE BW.

# Backspace encryption
Enigma encrypt using backspaces from 0 to 255 with one of the bytes to sign when the char is not possible. Or mark it in a different way (using the plaintext, we can skip that section while writing non-sense in that section, as it is not going to be used, it is just signalling to add a number of forward steps).
